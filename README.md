# Digit-Recognition
My first project involving machine learning

This is an implementation of a simple neural network in Python with NumPy. It is fully customisable â€” custom weights and biases can be imported and you can choose how many nodes there are in the hidden layer.
For this project, I trained it to be able to recognise handwritten digits with the MNIST database. I used PyGame to let the user draw their handwritten digit, which is run through the trained neural network and the values of the output layer are displayed.
